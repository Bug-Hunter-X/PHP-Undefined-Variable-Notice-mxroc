This code snippet demonstrates a common error in PHP related to undefined variables and notices.  The variable `$name` is used before it's defined, resulting in an undefined variable notice:

```php
<?php
echo "Hello, " . $name . "!";
?>
```
This typically isn't a fatal error, but generates a warning in the error log and might lead to unexpected behavior or subtle bugs.
